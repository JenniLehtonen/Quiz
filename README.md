## Quiz project

Used technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript and JSON.</br>
The questions, options and answers are stored into a JSON file.</br>
I have taken those questions, options and answers from a JSON file and stored them to different loops
and the program uses those loops in order to show questions etc. When the user goes to the next question
the indexes of the loops increase and the new question and the options shows up on the screen. After user
has choosed the option, the program checks if the right answer is chosen and then depending on the answer
the program either increases the score or not. At the end of the quiz the player sees their score and has the
ability to try again.
